# Power-Saver
DSM for the Masses

This project was scrapped early in its development due to changing interests and research into advanced competitors (Opower)

Power Saver was designed to translate complicated grid conditions into dollars and cents for everyday consumers.  Customers whose utilties utilize TOU pricing often don't understand what these prices mean to them.  Power Saver sets reminders that not only tell them when peak prices occur, but how much they could save by changing certain habits (ie doing laundry at a different time).  It was also intended to integrate IOT appliances so customers could automate their routines to maximize their savings.
